# ðŸ§± Java Basics â€“ Warm-Up Problems

This folder contains beginner-level Java programs to reinforce foundational concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, and simple input/output.

Each problem is written as a standalone Java file with a `main()` method, and is meant to build fluency before diving into deeper DSA topics.
