# ☕ DSA Prep in Java

This repository contains my daily preparation for Data Structures and Algorithms using **Java** as part of my roadmap to crack a FAANG/MAANG internship by the end of first year.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in Java for competitive coding
- Implement core algorithms from scratch
- Track learning across topics like arrays, sorting, recursion, strings, and more
- Solve LeetCode problems in Java
- Maintain clean, modular code for review and reuse

---

## 🗂️ Structure

```
dsa-prep-java/
├── algorithms/        # Sorting, searching, greedy, etc.
├── arrays/            # Array-based problems and techniques
├── recursion/         # Recursion, backtracking, divide and conquer
├── strings/           # String manipulation, pattern matching
├── notes/             # Big-O, complexity notes, theory references
└── README.md
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

All Java files are standard CLI programs. Use the following to run:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Ensure you have Java 17+ installed and environment variables set if running locally.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Java basics: variables, loops, input/output
- 🔄 Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort
- 📊 Big-O notation and complexity analysis
- 🔍 Searching: Binary Search (coming)
- 🔁 Recursion (coming)
- 💡 More DSA patterns coming soon...

---

## 📅 Roadmap Status

- Week 5: Start Java + basic DSA implementations
- Week 6: Expand to recursion, binary search
- Week 7+: Full LeetCode topic-wise prep in Java
